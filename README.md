# StringMethods
a static method called printEveryOther that takes a String as its parameter and prints every other character of the 
string â€“ i.e., the first character, the third character, etc. For example, a call of printEveryOther("method") should produce the following output:

mto

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a static method called longerLength that takes two String objects as parameters and returns the length of the longer of the two strings.
If the two strings have the same length, you should return that length. For example:

a call of longerLength("bye", "hello") should return 5, because 5 is the length of "hello", which is the longer of the two strings.

a call of longerLength("goodbye", "hi") should return 7, because 7 is the length of "goodbye", which is the longer of the two strings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a static method called secondIndexOf that takes as its two parameters a string str and a character ch and returns the index of the 
second occurrence of ch in str. For example:

a call of secondIndexOf("banana", 'a') should return 3, because the second occurrence of 'a' in "banana" occurs at position 3 in the string

a call of secondIndexOf("banana", 'n') should return 4, because the second occurrence of 'n' in "banana" occurs at position 4 in the string.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 a static method called lastNChars that takes as its two parameters a string str and an integer n, 
 and that returns a string consisting of the last n characters of str. For example:

a call of lastNChars("programming", 5) should return the string "mming"

a call of lastNChars("programming", 1) should return the string "g".
